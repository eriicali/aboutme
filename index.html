            <h3>Hey! It’s me, Erica 👋🏼 </h3><br>
            🇨🇦 I was born and raised in Ottawa, Canada. I’m in the Bachelor of Computer Science program at Carleton University, and I was accepted on a $4,000 renewable scholarship.
            <br><br>
            💻 I have experience with python, java, html/css, node.js, next.js, VB. I’ve been learning to code since grade 10! I was able to take an accelerated course in my first semester of uni thanks to this.
            <br><br>
            🤓 My CGPA is 11.5, and I enjoy solving interesting programming and math problems in my free time. <a href="https://github.com/CarletonComputerScienceSociety/advent-of-code-2020" style="color: #8db7d7;">Advent of Code</a> was something I REALLY enjoyed doing in December 2020.
            <br><br>
            🏫 I’ve tutored math to students in grades 8, 9, 10, and 11. I love seeing their faces light up when I finally help them understand a topic.

            <h3>What else am I up to? 👀</h3>
            <br>
            ✨ I am VP-elect of the <a href="https://ccss.carleton.ca/">Carleton Computer Science Society</a>! My term is from May 2021 to April 2022. I will be striving to make sure all students are heard, and leave a positive mark on the society.
            <br><br>
            ✨ I was on the website development team at <a href="https://technolgap.herokuapp.com/">Technolgap</a>, an Ottawa-based community of women in tech. You can see my work <a href="https://github.com/Technolgap/technolgap-website">here</a>.
            <br><br>
            ✨ I was also on the social media outreach team of Technolgap. I planned and created content to be displayed on the social media pages.
            <br><br>
            ✨ ️I enjoy participating in hackathons - so far, I’ve done Technica and cuHacking. <a href="https://github.com/AdiChops/lineup">Lineup</a> was our cuHacking submission.
            <br><br>
            ✨ I’ve done a few programming contests - namely the Canadian Computing Competition and the ECOO contest.
            <br><br>
            ✨I won the "hindsight" scholarship awarded by the Carleton Science Student Society. You can view my essay submission <a href="hindsightAward.html">here</a>.
